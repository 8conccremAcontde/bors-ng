## What is COD2 Pam Hack?
 
COD2 Pam Hack is a cheat tool that was created by a user named asdmanxD on unknowncheats.me[^1^]. It is based on a modified pam file, which is a configuration file that defines the rules and settings of a multiplayer match. By loading this pam file into the game, you can access a hidden script menu that lets you execute various commands that can give you an unfair advantage over your enemies.
 
## How to Use COD2 Pam Hack?
 
To use COD2 Pam Hack, you need to download the pam file from pastebin.com[^2^] and place it in your main folder of Call of Duty 2. Then, you need to join a server that allows custom pam files or create your own server with rcon access. Once you are in the game, you can open the console and type /openScriptMenu asd to open the script menu. From there, you can choose from different options that will activate the corresponding scripts.
 
## What Commands Can You Use with COD2 Pam Hack?
 
There are many commands that you can use with COD2 Pam Hack, depending on what you want to do. Here are some of the most popular ones:
 
- /openScriptMenu asd tichy - this command makes your shots connect to the enemy from greater distances by extending their hitboxes.
- /openScriptMenu asd tuz - this command spawns a fire that kills anyone who walks over it.
- /openScriptMenu asd hide - this command makes you invisible.
- /openScriptMenu asd rifleshotgun/kphax (head) - this command makes your shotgun and pistol act differently. Your shotgun bullets travel as far as a rifle bullet, and your pistol kills in one shot. The "head" option makes it appear that you have hit them in the head.
- /rcon lightwb/mediumwb/hardwb/extrawb [player number] - these commands are the rcon variants of the tichy command. They also allow you to hit players even behind walls. The extrawb one basically kills all enemies in one bullet.
- /rcon teleport [player number] - this command teleports you to your cursor's location.
- /rcon meteor/homokize/platsch [player number] - these commands spawn a homing meteor/sandstorm/flood above the targeted player, and upon contact they kill them.
- /rcon weapoff/weapon [player number] - these commands make the targeted player lose or gain back the ability to use weapons.
